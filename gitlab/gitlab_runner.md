## GitLab Runner

GitLab Runner is the open source project that is used to run your jobs and send the results back to GitLab. It is used in conjunction with GitLab CI, the open-source continuous integration service included with GitLab that coordinates the jobs.

## Requirements

GitLab Runner is written in Go and can be run as a single binary, no language specific requirements are needed.

It is designed to run on the GNU/Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems. Other operating systems will probably work as long as you can compile a Go binary on them.

If you want to use Docker make sure that you have version v1.5.0 at least installed.
